# Nick Funk Games

Over the years, I've built a lot of pet projects with [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and like most pet projects, they never see the light of day. So I figured, why not dump them into a website for folks to play around with and learn from?

This is the code for that site and its various project examples.

The live site is hosted here: https://games.nickfunk.com

I also use it to showcase some of the game dev libraries I've put together to speed up coding in Three.js.

## Game dev libraries

All of the following are provided on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) and are free to use (unless otherwise stated on the package page).

- `nf-pathfinder`
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/nf-pathfinder
  - An A* algorithm with binary heap traversal optimizations (includes Typescript bindings).

## Getting Started

I have been using node v20.14.0 and npm 10.7.0 when building and running the site.

```
npm i
npm run start
```

Then navigate to: `http://localhost:1234`
